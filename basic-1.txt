1. Describe the OSI Reference Model
- Open System Interconnections (OSI) is a network architecture model based on the ISO standards. It is called the OSI model as it deals with connecting the systems that are open for communication with other systems.


14. Describe the TCP/IP Reference Model
It is a compressed version of the OSI model with only 4 layers. It was developed by the US Department of Defence (DoD) in the 1980s. The name of this model is based on 2 standard protocols used i.e. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol).

15. Define the 4 different layers of the TCP/IP Reference Model

Layer	        Description
Link	        -Decides which links such as serial lines or classic Ethernet must be used to meet the needs of the connectionless internet layer.
Internet	    -The internet layer is the most important layer which holds the whole architecture together.It delivers the IP packets where they are supposed to be delivered.
Transport	    -Its functionality is almost the same as the OSI transport layer. It enables peer entities on the network to carry on a conversation.
Application	    -It contains all the higher-level protocols.
